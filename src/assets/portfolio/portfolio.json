Each illustration is a snapshot of my new life away from home and family, escorted by my childhood imaginary characters. The scenes are drawn realistically in black ink and are invaded by whimsical, colorful characters that are extracted from my numerous child drawings. The project is a tribute to the wonders of childhood and an attempt to reconcile the grown up and the child.\n",
